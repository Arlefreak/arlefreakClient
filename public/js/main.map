The Twitter handle itself in a Twitter match. If the match is '@someTwitterUser', the handle is 'someTwitterUser'.\n\t * 4. Group that matches an email address. Used to determine if the match is an email address, as well as holding the full \n\t *    address. Ex: 'me@my.com'\n\t * 5. Group that matches a URL in the input text. Ex: 'http://google.com', 'www.google.com', or just 'google.com'.\n\t *    This also includes a path, url parameters, or hash anchors. Ex: google.com/path/to/file?q1=1&q2=2#myAnchor\n\t * 6. Group that matches a protocol URL (i.e. 'http://google.com'). This is used to match protocol URLs with just a single\n\t *    word, like 'http://localhost', where we won't double check that the domain name has at least one '.' in it.\n\t * 7.
